Author: Paul Ivanov <pi (@.@) berkeley .:. edu>

I wrote this in 2010 for the annual [Vision
Science](http://vision.berkeley.edu/) retreat, and ran it again (with an
updated set of questions) at the 2012 retreat.

A set of sample questions is provided, so you should be able to just run 

    jpy/jpy

Editing questions and answers happens directly in jpy/data.py

One of the nice features is that you don't need to have the same number of
questions in every category.

The 'y' key will display an answer, the 'n' key will play a buzzer sound.
